## How to play
Each player takes a turn to select one letter.
If a player can make a word, they first click on their designated player number eg 'Player One', select the letters and submit the word.
If it is valid, the word will then be added to the players' list of words.
A player can 'steal' an opponents word by clicking on it if they think they can make a better word out of all its letters, and the letters on the board.
The game finishes when when it is no longer possible to make a valid word.
The player with the most words wins.
